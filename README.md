# Monte-Carlo-Simulation
Python code for Monte Carlo simulation of the Milky Way Bulge 
- Populate a sphere with points - distribution is chosen (equation provided for either uniform distribution or king profile distribution. Comment out the function you would NOT like to use)
- Set parameters for the stars: 10% of the stars will explode in a Supernova (SN)
- Set sterilization distance: any star that is within 50pc from an exploded star, will turn blue (sterilized by SN)
- Set AGN sterilization: any star that is within 200pc from the center of the Bulge (the active gal. nuclear, or AGN), will turn yellow (sterilized by AGN)
- Each iteration will save a histogram showing the final results -- how many stars in each category
